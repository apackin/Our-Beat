# Our Beat 

Our beat is a music creation application for those who enjoy rythmic music to create, share and collaborate on custom beats with friends. I used Tone.js' synthasizers to create custom lead and bass parts along with samples for drums, uplifts and bass drops. 

## Usage
Notes will play in sequence starting with the left most column.

#### Select Notes
Click on cells in the matrix that are in the row labelled with the note that you would like to play. Each column represents a 1/8th note.

#### Custamize Notes
Use the drop down menus on the left side to select the note and octive/option of that note that you would like to play in that row. 

#### Control Play
Click on the start button at the bottom of the page or use the space bar to start or pause the sequencer.
